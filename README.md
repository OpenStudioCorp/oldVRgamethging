# Open-NBS-VR

# i'm soooo sorry for doing this but i must say it's been great doing this! 

# for now i have to put this on indefininte hold... i know, it makes me sad too but i --charlie-- dont have the required skills and i just jumped in blind without learning how unity works.

### maybe at somepoint in the future when we have more c# developers, we can make it again. this repo will still be here, may make some things for it, idk. we will see.

have a great one!

The official repository for OpenNoteBlockStudioVR!

Welcome to the plaza! We hope that you will like this place!

This repo is currently in beta so some things may be missing/incomplete

you can check out the development progress with this progress bar that we quickly put together.

[----------------------------------] for now it's empty as the work we have is not good enough for putting into the progress bar.
